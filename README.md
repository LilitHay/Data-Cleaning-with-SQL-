# Data-Cleaning-with-SQL

In this repository I arrange data cleaning process of Nashville Housing Dataset with SQL.
During the cleaning process I converted and standartized date format by using CONVERT function, populated property address data by using JOINS and IS NULL function,
CHARINDEX, SUBSTRING and PARSENAME functions for splitting full address data. 
Also I have used CASE WHEN statements, made a common table expression (CTE) and applied windows functions.
